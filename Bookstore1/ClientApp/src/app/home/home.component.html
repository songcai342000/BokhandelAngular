      <p>
        Forest Bookstore was opened by John Kenny and his wife Mary Kenny in 1946. It was in a tiny size for only one year and has become the largest bookstore in the country since 1956.
        Today it is one of the biggest tax contributer in the state. Except the contributions to
        cultural and economic development, we provide constantly support to public service and donate continually to environmental protection,
        health care and education.
